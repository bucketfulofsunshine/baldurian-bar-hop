# Baldurian Bar Hop(ping)
A collection of whimsical D&D encounters set within the city of Baldurâ€™s Gate.

Take part in a drinking contest with dwarves, challenge an amateur bard to a friendly contest - or even an impromptu duet - and start a tavern brawl to see how things unfold.

The taverns and inns of Baldur's Gate are brimming with adventure for those brave enough to seek it out. Survive the chaos and your party may earn some truly unique (and often humorous) rewards.

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I find these encounters?

A: By doing what the mod's name suggests: hopping from tavern-to-inn and seeking out the new NPCs within.

### Q: Does this add balanced gameplay?

A: Highly unlikely. The reward items are meant to be weird and whimsical. So, whatever I think is amusing, gets added to the pile. Some items might empower the party, others may cause they to be underpowered during fights.

## CHANGELOG

#### 20250104 - Nightly.

* Added an option to drink with dwarves and win the Dwarven Mug-on-a-Stick item. A unique mace with questionable origins.

## FUTURE PLANS


* Add a contest or duet with a bard (if the player also has a Bard-class level). Or rest a moment to enjoy the music / heckle them instead. 

* A group of thieves are trying to smuggle crates of ale through the tavern. Assist them in their task or get them arrested.

* An inn room is haunted by a former resident. Shaman CHARNAMEs can speak with the ghost and solve the mystery (IWD-2 callback).

* Rats in a tavern cellar. The classic conundrum. Druids can talk to the rats and get them to move to greener pastures.

* Master of Riddles. A mage claims to know more than all his peers combined. Challenge him to a duel of wits.

* More mystery, more adventure, more...romance?

## LICENSING

While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. adding new lines for classes/races), crossmod is free real estate. You can contact me to co-write / co-code it.
