# Baldurian Bar Hop
A collection of tongue-in-cheek D&D encounters for BGEE.

Take part in a drinking contest with dwarves, or assist an Avowed of Candlekeep with delivering a book.

The taverns & inns of Baldur's Gate are brimming with adventures for those brave enough to seek them out. Survive the chaos & your party may earn some truly unique (& often humorous) rewards.

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I find these encounters?

A: By doing what the mod's name suggests: hopping from tavern-to-inn & seeking out the new NPCs within.

### Q: Does this add balanced gameplay?

A: Highly unlikely. The encounters & rewards are meant to be weird and whimsical. So, whatever I think is amusing, gets added to the pile. Some items might empower the party, others may cause them to be underpowered.

## CHANGELOG

#### 20250902 - Nightly.

* Completed Fully Booked & Plot Twist. Three quests can now be completed.

## FUTURE PLANS

* *Liquid Assets*. A group of thieves are trying to smuggle crates of ale through the tavern. Assist them in their task or get them arrested.

* *Room for One More*. An inn room is haunted by a former resident. Shamans can speak with the ghost & solve the mystery (IWD-2 callback).

* *Mice to Meet You*. Rats in a tavern cellar. The classic conundrum. Druids can talk to the rats & get them to move to greener pastures.

* *At Wit's End*. A mage claims to know more than all his peers combined. Challenge him to a duel of wits.

* More mystery, more adventure, more...romance?
