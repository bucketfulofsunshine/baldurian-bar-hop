# Baldurian Bar Hop
A collection of tongue-in-cheek D&D encounters for BGEE.

Take part in a drinking contest with dwarves, challenge an amateur bard to a friendly contest - or even an impromptu duet - & start a tavern brawl to see how things unfold.

The taverns and inns of Baldur's Gate are brimming with adventures for those brave enough to seek them out. Survive the chaos & your party may earn some truly unique (& often humorous) rewards.

## FAQ

### Q: Where can I find these encounters?

A: By doing what the mod's name suggests: hopping from tavern-to-inn & seeking out the new NPCs within.

### Q: Does this add balanced gameplay?

A: Highly unlikely. The encounters & rewards are meant to be weird and whimsical. So, whatever I think is amusing, gets added to the pile. Some items might empower the party, others may cause them to be underpowered.

## CHANGELOG

#### 20250104 - Nightly.

* Added an option to drink with dwarves & win the *Dwarven Mug-on-a-Stick* - a unique mace with questionable origins.

#### 20250830 - Nightly.

* Completely restructured the mod. Started on implementation of Fully Booked, Plot Twist & Dress to Distress.

## FUTURE PLANS

* Add a contest or duet with a bard (if the player also has a Bard-class level). Or rest a moment to enjoy the music / heckle them instead. 

* A group of thieves are trying to smuggle crates of ale through the tavern. Assist them in their task or get them arrested.

* An inn room is haunted by a former resident. Shamans can speak with the ghost and solve the mystery (IWD-2 callback).

* Rats in a tavern cellar. The classic conundrum. Druids can talk to the rats & get them to move to greener pastures.

* Master of Riddles. A mage claims to know more than all his peers combined. Challenge him to a duel of wits.

* More mystery, more adventure, more...romance?

## LICENSING
